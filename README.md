Serene
A simple, calm little website I built to help me focus. It’s just a Pomodoro timer, but I wanted it to feel peaceful—clean design, smooth animations, no clutter.
It’s all vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS, so it loads fast and works anywhere. I've been tweaking it here and there to fix bugs and make sure it stays accessible.
